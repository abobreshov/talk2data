# Task 17: Final Validation and Testing (Updated)

## Objective
Validate the generated orders data against all business requirements and create verification queries.

## Validation Steps

### 1. Connect to Database and Basic Stats (Including Sales)
```python
import duckdb
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from datetime import datetime

# Connect to databases
orders_conn = duckdb.connect('src/data/orders.duckdb')
products_conn = duckdb.connect('src/data/products.duckdb')

# Basic statistics
print("=== DATABASE SUMMARY ===")
total_orders = orders_conn.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders").fetchone()[0]
total_items = orders_conn.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_items").fetchone()[0]
total_sales = orders_conn.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales").fetchone()[0]
total_customers = orders_conn.execute("SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customerId) FROM orders").fetchone()[0]

print(f"Total orders: {total_orders:,}")
print(f"Total order items: {total_items:,}")
print(f"Total sales records: {total_sales:,}")
print(f"Total customers: {total_customers:,}")
print(f"Average items per order: {total_items/total_orders:.1f}")
```

### 2. Validate Order Status Distribution
```python
print("\n=== ORDER STATUS VALIDATION ===")

# Check status distribution
status_dist = orders_conn.execute("""
    SELECT 
        orderStatus,
        COUNT(*) as count,
        COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER() as percentage
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY orderStatus
    ORDER BY count DESC
""").fetchdf()

print(status_dist)

# Validate cancellation rate
cancelled_pct = orders_conn.execute("""
    SELECT 
        COUNT(CASE WHEN orderStatus = 'CANCELLED' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / 
        COUNT(CASE WHEN deliveryDate < CURRENT_DATE THEN 1 END) as cancellation_rate
    FROM orders
    WHERE deliveryDate < CURRENT_DATE
""").fetchone()[0]

print(f"\nCancellation rate for past orders: {cancelled_pct:.2f}%")
print(f"Target was 0.5%, Actual: {cancelled_pct:.2f}%")
```

### 3. Validate Price Constraints
```python
print("\n=== PRICE VALIDATION ===")

# Price distribution for non-cancelled orders
price_stats = orders_conn.execute("""
    SELECT 
        MIN(totalPrice) as min_price,
        MAX(totalPrice) as max_price,
        AVG(totalPrice) as avg_price,
        PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY totalPrice) as q1,
        PERCENTILE_CONT(0.50) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY totalPrice) as median,
        PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY totalPrice) as q3
    FROM orders
    WHERE orderStatus != 'CANCELLED'
""").fetchone()

print(f"Price range: £{price_stats[0]:.2f} - £{price_stats[1]:.2f}")
print(f"Average price: £{price_stats[2]:.2f} (Target: £38)")
print(f"Median price: £{price_stats[4]:.2f}")
print(f"Quartiles: Q1=£{price_stats[3]:.2f}, Q3=£{price_stats[5]:.2f}")

# Check orders outside range
out_of_range = orders_conn.execute("""
    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM orders 
    WHERE orderStatus != 'CANCELLED' 
    AND (totalPrice < 20 OR totalPrice > 100)
""").fetchone()[0]

print(f"\nOrders outside £20-£100 range: {out_of_range}")
```

### 4. Validate Customer Distribution
```python
print("\n=== CUSTOMER DISTRIBUTION VALIDATION ===")

# Orders per customer per week
customer_weekly = orders_conn.execute("""
    WITH customer_weeks AS (
        SELECT 
            customerId,
            DATE_TRUNC('week', orderDate) as week,
            COUNT(*) as orders_in_week
        FROM orders
        GROUP BY customerId, DATE_TRUNC('week', orderDate)
    )
    SELECT 
        AVG(orders_in_week) as avg_orders_per_week,
        MIN(orders_in_week) as min_orders,
        MAX(orders_in_week) as max_orders,
        PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY orders_in_week) as median_orders
    FROM customer_weeks
""").fetchone()

print(f"Average orders per customer per week: {customer_weekly[0]:.2f}")
print(f"Range: {customer_weekly[1]} - {customer_weekly[2]}")
print(f"Median: {customer_weekly[3]}")

# Customer order frequency
customer_stats = orders_conn.execute("""
    SELECT 
        COUNT(CASE WHEN order_count < 52 THEN 1 END) as low_frequency,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN order_count BETWEEN 52 AND 156 THEN 1 END) as normal_frequency,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN order_count > 156 THEN 1 END) as high_frequency
    FROM (
        SELECT customerId, COUNT(*) as order_count
        FROM orders
        GROUP BY customerId
    )
""").fetchone()

print(f"\nCustomer frequency distribution:")
print(f"Low (<1/week): {customer_stats[0]}")
print(f"Normal (1-3/week): {customer_stats[1]}")
print(f"High (>3/week): {customer_stats[2]}")
```

### 5. Validate Delivery Date Logic
```python
print("\n=== DELIVERY DATE VALIDATION ===")

# Check delivery date distribution
delivery_stats = orders_conn.execute("""
    SELECT 
        deliveryDate - orderDate as delivery_days,
        COUNT(*) as count
    FROM orders
    WHERE orderStatus != 'CANCELLED'
    GROUP BY delivery_days
    ORDER BY delivery_days
""").fetchdf()

print("Delivery days distribution:")
print(delivery_stats)

# Validate status by delivery date
status_validation = orders_conn.execute("""
    WITH status_check AS (
        SELECT 
            CASE 
                WHEN deliveryDate < CURRENT_DATE THEN 'past'
                WHEN deliveryDate = CURRENT_DATE THEN 'today'
                ELSE 'future'
            END as delivery_period,
            orderStatus,
            COUNT(*) as count
        FROM orders
        GROUP BY delivery_period, orderStatus
    )
    SELECT * FROM status_check
    ORDER BY delivery_period, orderStatus
""").fetchdf()

print("\nStatus by delivery period:")
print(status_validation)
```

### 6. Validate Product Distribution
```python
print("\n=== PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION VALIDATION ===")

# Most popular products
popular_products = orders_conn.execute("""
    SELECT 
        oi.productId,
        COUNT(DISTINCT oi.orderId) as order_count,
        SUM(oi.quantity) as total_quantity,
        SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price) as total_revenue
    FROM order_items oi
    JOIN orders o ON oi.orderId = o.orderId
    WHERE o.orderStatus != 'CANCELLED'
    GROUP BY oi.productId
    ORDER BY order_count DESC
    LIMIT 20
""").fetchdf()

print(f"Top 20 most ordered products:")
print(popular_products.head())

# Product category distribution
# Join with products database to get category info
category_dist = orders_conn.execute("""
    ATTACH DATABASE 'src/data/products.duckdb' AS products_db;
    
    WITH product_sales AS (
        SELECT 
            p.category,
            COUNT(DISTINCT oi.orderId) as orders,
            SUM(oi.quantity) as units_sold,
            SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price) as revenue
        FROM order_items oi
        JOIN orders o ON oi.orderId = o.orderId
        JOIN products_db.products p ON oi.productId = p.productId
        WHERE o.orderStatus != 'CANCELLED'
        GROUP BY p.category
    )
    SELECT * FROM product_sales
""").fetchdf()

print("\nSales by category:")
print(category_dist)
```

### 7. Validate Sales Table
```python
print("\n=== SALES TABLE VALIDATION ===")

# Check 1: Sales records match delivered order items
delivered_items_count = orders_conn.execute("""
    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM orders o
    JOIN order_items oi ON o.orderId = oi.orderId
    WHERE o.orderStatus = 'DELIVERED'
""").fetchone()[0]

sales_count = orders_conn.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales").fetchone()[0]

print(f"Delivered order items: {delivered_items_count}")
print(f"Sales records: {sales_count}")
print(f"Match: {'✓' if sales_count == delivered_items_count else '✗ MISMATCH!'}")

# Check 2: No sales for cancelled orders
cancelled_sales = orders_conn.execute("""
    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM sales s
    JOIN orders o ON s.orderId = o.orderId
    WHERE o.orderStatus = 'CANCELLED'
""").fetchone()[0]

print(f"\nSales for cancelled orders: {cancelled_sales}")
print(f"Correct (should be 0): {'✓' if cancelled_sales == 0 else '✗ ERROR!'}")

# Check 3: Sales dates match delivery dates
date_mismatches = orders_conn.execute("""
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM sales s
    JOIN orders o ON s.orderId = o.orderId
    WHERE DATE(s.saleDate) != DATE(o.deliveryDate)
""").fetchone()[0]

print(f"\nSales with incorrect dates: {date_mismatches}")
print(f"Correct (should be 0): {'✓' if date_mismatches == 0 else '✗ ERROR!'}")

# Sales summary
sales_summary = orders_conn.execute("""
    SELECT 
        COUNT(DISTINCT saleDate) as sale_days,
        COUNT(DISTINCT productId) as products_sold,
        SUM(quantity) as total_units,
        SUM(quantity * price) as total_revenue,
        AVG(quantity * price) as avg_sale_value
    FROM sales
""").fetchone()

print(f"\nSales Summary:")
print(f"  - Sale days: {sales_summary[0]}")
print(f"  - Unique products sold: {sales_summary[1]}")
print(f"  - Total units sold: {sales_summary[2]:,}")
print(f"  - Total revenue: £{sales_summary[3]:,.2f}")
print(f"  - Average sale value: £{sales_summary[4]:.2f}")
```
